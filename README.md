[![Terraform Open Source Modules](https://docs.cloudposse.com/images/terraform-open-source-modules.svg)][terraform_modules]



It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).







We literally have [*hundreds of terraform modules*][terraform_modules] that are Open Source and well-maintained. Check them out! 







## Usage


**IMPORTANT:** The `master` branch is used in `source` just as an example. In your code, do not pin to `master` because there may be breaking changes between releases.
Instead pin to the release tag (e.g. `?ref=tags/x.y.z`) of one of our [latest releases](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-rds-cloudwatch-sns-alarms/releases).

| Storage | BurstBalance     | `<`                  | 20 %      | 20 % of credits allow you to burst for a few minutes which gives you enough time to a) fix the inefficiency, b) add capacity or c) switch to io1 storage type.                                         |
| Storage | DiskQueueDepth   | `>`                  | 64        | This number is calculated from our experience with RDS workloads.                                                                                                                                      |
| Storage | FreeStorageSpace | `<`                  | 2 GB      | 2 GB usually provides enough time to a) fix why so much space is consumed or b) add capacity. You can also modify this value to 10% of your database capacity.                                         |
| CPU     | CPUUtilization   | `>`                  | 80 %      | Queuing theory tells us the latency increases exponentially with utilization. In practice, we see higher latency when utilization exceeds 80% and unacceptable high latency with utilization above 90% |
| CPU     | CPUCreditBalance | `<`                  | 20        | One credit equals 1 minute of 100% usage of a vCPU. 20 credits should give you enough time to a) fix the inefficiency, b) add capacity or c) don't use t2 type.                                        |
| Memory  | FreeableMemory   | `<`                  | 64 MB     | This number is calculated from our experience with RDS workloads.                                                                                                                                      |
| Memory  | SwapUsage        | `>`                  | 256 MB    | Sometimes you can not entirely avoid swapping. But once the database accesses paged memory, it will slow down.                                                                                         |
