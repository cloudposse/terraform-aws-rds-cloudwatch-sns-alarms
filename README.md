# terraform-aws-rds-cloudwatch-sns-alarms

 [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cloudposse/terraform-aws-rds-cloudwatch-sns-alarms.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cloudposse/terraform-aws-rds-cloudwatch-sns-alarms) [![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/cloudposse/terraform-aws-rds-cloudwatch-sns-alarms.svg)](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-rds-cloudwatch-sns-alarms/releases) [![Slack Community](https://slack.cloudposse.com/badge.svg)](https://slack.cloudposse.com)


Terraform module that configures important RDS alerts using CloudWatch and sends them to the chosen SNS topic.

Create a set of sane RDS CloudWatch alerts for monitoring the health of an RDS instance.

| Storage | BurstBalance     | `<`                  | 20 %      | 20 % of credits allow you to burst for a few minutes which gives you enough time to a) fix the inefficiency, b) add capacity or c) switch to io1 storage type.                                         |
| Storage | DiskQueueDepth   | `>`                  | 64        | This number is calculated from our experience with RDS workloads.                                                                                                                                      |
| Storage | FreeStorageSpace | `<`                  | 2 GB      | 2 GB usually provides enough time to a) fix why so much space is consumed or b) add capacity. You can also modify this value to 10% of your database capacity.                                         |
| CPU     | CPUUtilization   | `>`                  | 80 %      | Queuing theory tells us the latency increases exponentially with utilization. In practice, we see higher latency when utilization exceeds 80% and unacceptable high latency with utilization above 90% |
| CPU     | CPUCreditBalance | `<`                  | 20        | One credit equals 1 minute of 100% usage of a vCPU. 20 credits should give you enough time to a) fix the inefficiency, b) add capacity or c) don't use t2 type.                                        |
| Memory  | FreeableMemory   | `<`                  | 64 MB     | This number is calculated from our experience with RDS workloads.                                                                                                                                      |
| Memory  | SwapUsage        | `>`                  | 256 MB    | Sometimes you can not entirely avoid swapping. But once the database accesses paged memory, it will slow down.                                                                                         |

The module will also alert on `failure` type events. See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_Events.html for a list of events.
